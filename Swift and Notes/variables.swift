 // var means normal variable
var name = "Kushal"
// let means constant variable
let gender = "Male" // if i initialize it with a value i don't need to specify the type like "String" here as the language automatically knows the type of the variable
print(name + " is a " + gender)
let number: Float = 4
print(number)

// not necessary but we can specify types in swift
// for eg
var age = 19
// generally we dont necessarily need to type that Int so a good practice is to not type the type
